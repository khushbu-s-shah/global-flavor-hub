# global-flavor-hub
For this project, we have used Clerk for authentication and MongoDB with Prisma as a data storage option. The project is created in Next.js using typescript.

Global Flavor Hub will be a platform for a food blog where users can upload their recipes and view other users' recipes. Users can search for recipes by recipe name and sort the recipes by "Less Cooking Time" or "Newest First." They will be able to see their own uploaded recipes and can update or delete them as needed. The category tab allows users to filter recipes based on specific categories. The "Add Recipe" feature allows users to upload new recipes. Additionally, users can rate recipes and save them to their accounts for future reference.

#Clone from GitHub: 
npm install
npm run dev

Future Planning:
We plan to keep working on this project and add a language option for users to view the recipes in their preferred language. Additionally, we will introduce a new tab that will display recipes based on various dietary restrictions or preferences, such as vegan, gluten-free, or low-carb options. This will provide users with more personalized recipe recommendations to suit their individual needs and preferences using an API.
